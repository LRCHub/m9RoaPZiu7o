# Pentatonix – Christmas Eve

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
All alone I watch the quiet rain
Wonder if it's gonna snow again
Silent Night, Holy Night
I was praying you'd be here with me
but Christmas Eve ain't
what it used to be Silent
Night, Holy Night
If you were beside me
Then I could hear angels
And I'd give you rainbows,
for Christmas
Somewhere far away the sleighbells ring
I remember when we used to sing
Silent Night, Holy Night
I keep you inside me
Oh the truth is unspoken,
So my heart won't be broken,
on Christmas
They lit the trees
along the avenue
Twinkling silver with a touch of blue
Silent Night, Holy Night
