Here's to you baby
May Christmas bring you happiness
Oh, here's to you baby
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest

Yeah, Merry Christmas baby, Happy New Year
Have fun because Christmas don't come but once a year
Here's to you honey
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest

All the presents my love, under the Christmas tree
Remind me of your love that means so much to me (here's to you)
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time baby
Like we did on all the rest

We'll enjoy ourselves together, Christmas dinners and everything
We'll share every little pleasure every Christmas brings here's to you
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest

I wanna be home with you baby when New Years roll around
We'll make our resolutions before the sun goes down
Here's to you, honey
May Christmas bring you happiness
Want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest
