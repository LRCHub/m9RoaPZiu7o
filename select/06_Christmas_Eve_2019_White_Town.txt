It's Christmas Eve 2019
You first hear these words
And wonder what they mean
And I
Feel your smile
Like a flower feels the sun
The light in your eyes
Is a precious thing
I've never felt so free
As in this love
I've been been more me
Than in this love
And all this is due
To the one I'm singing to
It's Christmas Eve 2019
It's Christmas Eve 2029
I'm in your arms
Or are you in mine
And I
Sing this song
I've been singing ten years gone
You sing along
You know the words by heart
It's Christmas Eve 2066
You're 84
And you're looking through our pics
You
Dig out this song
And you smile as you sing along
We made some memories
You and I
